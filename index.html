						<h2>Who I Am</h2>
					</header>
					<p>I am a Vietnamese American that speaks English, Vietnamese, and a little Spanish. Fun fact, I am a proud graduate of the first Bachelor's in AI & Robotics in America. As a post grad trying to find a job, I spend most of my days building
						up my portfolio whether it be creating new data science projects, general AI projects, or a little bit of both.
					When I'm not job searching or project building, I like to go jogging, fishing, playing badminton, catching up with old friends, and hanging around my church community.</br><strong>Here is my resume if interested:</strong><a href="images/2026.pdf"> Download Resume PDF</a> </p>
